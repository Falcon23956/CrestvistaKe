Crestvista site - CMS notes
- listings.json contains property data. Edit it to add/remove properties.
- Each property should have: id, title, location, price, beds, description, images (array of paths)
- Images placed under assets/images/ and referenced in listings.json
- script.js reads listings.json and renders pages. No server required.
